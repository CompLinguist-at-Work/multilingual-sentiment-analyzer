# Multilingual Sentiment Analyzer

This project builds a simple sentiment analysis tool for Hindi and English texts.  
It detects language and classifies sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.  
The goal is to showcase my skills in NLP and computational linguistics.

Planned features: language detection, sentiment classification, demo script.
